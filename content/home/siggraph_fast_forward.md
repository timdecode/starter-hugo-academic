My PhD thesis–**[LifeBrush: An illustrative simulation canvas for the biological mesoscale](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/111493)**–won an honorable mention at SIGGRAPH 2020's thesis fast forward session. My thesis is about painting 3D molecular landscapes within an interactive virtual reality canvas. We bring these molecular illustrations to life with realtime coarse-grained simulation based on agent-based modelling.
