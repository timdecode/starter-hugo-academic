        Embark on an interstellar journey with "ShipCraft" a riveting VR game where you engineer intricate spacecraft. You'll wield cutting-edge CAD tools in virtual reality, crafting spaceships right down to the engine's fuel flow rates.

Each challenge pits you against the merciless void of space. Can you mend a malfunctioning ship hurtling toward a gas giant?

I put this project on hold to finish my PhD. Its innovative simulation and VR crafting technology lay the groundwork for my LifeBrush system.
