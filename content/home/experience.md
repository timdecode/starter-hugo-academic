  - title: "Ship Editor"
    company: 'Me'
    date_start: '2016-01-01'
    date_end: '2017-01-01'

        Ship Editor is a VR ship building game with realistic physics. Players design a ship with CAD like tools in VR. Every detail of the ship is modelled, down to the flow rates of fuel into the engines. The game is a series of challenges. The first challenge starts with the player on a broken ship in a decaying orbit. The player must repair the ship before it plunges into the looming gas giant. I put this project on hold to finish my PhD thesis and I would love to revive it someday. The techonology that I developed for simulating the ship and building things in VR form the foundations of my LifeBrush system.


  - title: "Software Developer"
    company: "SimuDenseEndo"
    company_url: ""
    location: "Germany"
    date_start: "2014-09-01"
    date_end: "2015-05-01"
    description: |2-
        The goal of SimuDensEndo was to bring virtual reality to the field of dental surgery training, our technology leveraged the Oculus Rift VR hreadset and the Leap Motion hand tracking device. I helped develop volumetric rendering and physics software that translated high resolution scans of real teeth into objects that could be drilled in an interactive endodontic simulation environment.
