# Abstract

The Lindsay Composer was an engine powering many of the experiences in the Lindsay Virtual Human Project. I originally developed it for my MSc thesis as the OmijaEngine. When I joined the Lindsay project in 2009, I renamed it the Lindsay Composer, and oversaw its development. Over the course of the project, the composer powered several experiences around human physiology and anatomy. Many people have contributed to the Composer, in particular, our two full time programmers Scott Steil and Carey Gingras. At the time, engines like Unity and Unreal were not readily available.

The research projects in the video below were developed with the composer by members of the lab.
