# Abstract

In 2016 my supervisor Christian Jacob presented the Lindsay Virtual Human Project at TEDx. I built this red-blood cell cross section for his talk. What's particularly cool about this red blood cell is that it's procedurally generated, on-the fly, as the camera flies around the scene. It utilized my discrete element texture synthesis algorithm to do its magic.
