I'm a computer scientist bringing the world of molecular biology to life. I specialize in computer graphics, realtime simulation, agent-based modelling and virtual reality. My [PhD (2020)](https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/111493/ucalgary_2020_davison_timothy.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) at the University of Calgary was about painting living 3D biomolecular landscapes in virtual reality ([see this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocT7W3o8CfE)). 

I take [photos](photography/drone_2021), brew beer, play computer games, and hike.
