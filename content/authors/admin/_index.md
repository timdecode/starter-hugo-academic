I'm a computer scientist bringing the world of molecular biology to life. I'm an expert in computer graphics, agent-based modelling, virtual reality and game engine architecture. My Ph.D. at the University of Calgary (2019) was about painting living 3D biomolecule landscapes in virtual reality. 

I take pictures, brew beer, play computer games, and hike.
